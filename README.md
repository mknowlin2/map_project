# map_project
A simple responsive web application built to demonstrate my knowledge of leveraging third party APIs.

## Project Overview:
Develop a single-page application featuring a Google map of a neighborhood which contains markers. The application will leverage third party APIs to provide information about the markers. Additional required functionality is a filterable list of marker locations which are selectable.

### Frameworks
* Bootstrap - Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS.

### Third Party APIs
* Google Maps - The Maps JavaScript API lets you customize maps with your own content and imagery for display on web pages and mobile devices.
* Foursquare - Foursquare provides the Places API which provides detailed information about locations upon request.

### Javascript Library
* JQuery - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
* Knockoutjs - Knockout is a JavaScript library that helps you to create rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with a clean underlying data model.

### Quick Start Guide
